# Computing E-POS
### This is my A-Level coursework project for my Computer Science Qualification
The project is split into 2 key parts:
# 1. The Backend Server (ASP.Net Core)
This backend server exposes a RESTful API built in C# using the ASP.NET Core framework.
It allows for the management of a SQLite 3 Database over the web via a multitude of REST endpoints
# 2. The Frontend Till Software (C# WPF)
While this frontend is _not_ my proudest work, it is functional if you look past all of the spaghetti garbage.
